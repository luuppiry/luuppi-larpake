Luuppi is student organization for computer science, mathematics and statistical data analysis students in Tampere University Finland. 

Fuksilärpäke is traditional part of freshman year for students in Luuppi. Fresmen compete on who gathers the most points during their freshman year. You can get points by fro example attending different events organized by Luuppi and other university organizations. Those with the most points are awarded with different prizes at the Luuppi Christmas party.

`ASP.NET Core` `.NET9` `C#` `C# 13` `Web API` `Controllers` `REST` `JWT` `OpenApi Scalar` `Dependency Injection`

In the heart of the Lärpäke is the REST api implemented using ASP.NET Core Web API with controllers. Api is implemented using RESTful architechture and fro easier use, OpenApi Scalar is used to visualize api endpoints and their request data. Authentication and authorization are implemented using json web tokens (JWT). As usual, services are managed by dependency injection (DI). 


#### Database
`PostgreSQL` `Dapper`

The web API uses PostgreSQL database to store all the data created by user clients. Dapper ORM is used in the C# code to map sql query results into objects. For those interested, database graphs can be found `Wiki` -pages under `Database Graphs` ([here](https://github.com/henrivain/Larpake/wiki/Diagrams)).

#### Api Events

`SSE`

Web api serves Server Sent Events (SSE) for subscribed clients when user's event attendance is marked as completed hereby causing UI update. 

### Front End

`Vite` `Typescript` `CSS` `HTML`

Front end is built with minimal vite + Typescript, HTML, CSS stack. 

For UI design drawings see `Wiki` -> `Design` ([here](https://github.com/henrivain/Larpake/wiki/Design)).
